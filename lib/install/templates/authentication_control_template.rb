# Include this module in your controller to enable the authentication system for that
# controller
#
# == Setting up the authentication control system ==
#
# 1. Define an instance method on the controller class to define which model is the
#    Authenticatable class (i.e the "User" class)
#
#    You must define a method named `auth_model_class` for the controller that includes
#    this module. `auth_model_class` must return the model to use as a "User" class. For
#    example, if the model representing your users is named `Person``, then you must define
#    a protected method in your controller that will return that class. See example below.
#
#    Of course, the model you specify must include the AuthenticatedModel module (concern).
#
# 2. Define an instance method on the controller class that will define the session Hash key 
#    to store the user id.
#
#    You must define a method named `session_auth_key` for the controller that includes
#    this module. `session_auth_key` must return a symbol to use as the key in the session
#    Hash that stores the ID of an authentified user.
#
#    This is especially important if you will have more than one session namespaces and
#    more than a single user model that can be authentified.
#
#    For example, you may have a Person model that will be authenticated in the /public/
#    section of your application, and a Admin model that will be authenticated in the
#    /admin/ section. If an authenticated Person with ID = 1 tries to access the /admin/
#    section, then the value in the session must be different, otherwise, the Person will be
#    considered as the Admin with the same ID. By using different keys in the session Hash,
#    you ensure that Person and Admin sessions will not collide.
#
# 3. Define the session Hash key to store current location
#
#    You must define a method named `session_location_store_key` in the controller class
#    that includes this module. `session_location_store_key` must return a symbol to use
#    as the key to store the request_uri that will be used to perform redirections after
#    logins and logouts by users.
#
# 4. Define if single device sessions should be enabled. When enabled, the model class must 
#    have a persisted attribute (table column) named 
#
# == Example Use ==
#
# class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#    include AuthenticationControl
#    ...
#    protected
#
#    def auth_model_class
#       Person
#    end
#
#    def session_auth_key
#       :person_auth_id
#    end
#
#    def session_location_store_key
#       :return_to
#    end
#
#    # defaults to true in staging and production environment, so override in controller if needed
#    def single_device_sessions 
#      AppConfig.single_device_sessions
#    end
#
#    ...
# end
#
# The Person model should in turn include AuthenticatedModel, so that it provides the
# necessary methods to deal with this authentication module
#
# class Person
#   include AuthenticatedModel
#   ...
# end
#
